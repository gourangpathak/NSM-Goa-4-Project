# NSM-Goa-4-Project
In this Project I worked on Computational modelling of pedestrian flow
through an exit, my task was to model the flow of pedestrians through a 
door as an agent based model and further deduce their motions based on 
"Social Forces" which are defined by the following differential Equation

## Demo of Simulation for 50 Persons inside a Room

Further I had to Analyze the flow rates and leaving times as a function of the 
desired velocity, also observe the variation of Number of People Escaping the room
v/s the time taken for escape, 
To solve the ODE I have utilized the ODE 4,5 Solver, though being computationally
expensive it takes long time to run.
